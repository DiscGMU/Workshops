												<h2>Quantitative/Qualitative Workshops</h2>
                                                <p>All workshops created by Debby Kermer</p>
											</header>
											<li><a href="">Computing Efficiently for Data</a></li>
											<p>Do you know what to do if double-clicking a file doesn't open it properly? Do you know what RAM is and how applications use it? Have you seen or heard the terms GUI (pronounced "goo-ee") and CLI, but don't know what they mean?Most people use their computer every day for a wide variety of general computing tasks and never need to know these things. But, when working with data and using specialized software, there is more you should know.Learn about interacting with your computer with the keyboard, installing applications, and important features of file explorer/finder. Also, get a walk-through of connecting to and using the Citrix Virtual Lab to access Mason-Licensed software from your own computer.</p>
                                            <li><a href="">Computer Science for Data Researchers</a></li>
											<p>Do you know what a "byte" is and how it relates to data descriptors such as "ASCII" and "double"? Do you hear about "text files" and "markdown", but don't know what the big deal is?  Have you seen the terms "operator" and "argument" in tutorials but weren't sure what they referred to?You don't have to get a degree in Computer Science to work with data, but a foundational knowledge of how computers work and programming terminology will help you get to the next level in efficiency and better understand and troubleshoot your work. First, learn about data types and file encodings, with a focus on the text file type such as markdown documents, delimited data files, and script files. Then, get an overview of basic programming terms and concepts.This workshop assumes knowledge of basic data words such as variable, observation, and values and exposure to (though not necessarily comfort with) a data software such as SPSS, Stata, SAS, R, or Excel Pivot Tables. Basic knowledge of file extensions (equivalent to the overview in the Computer Skills workshop) is also assumed.</p>
											<li><a href="">Selecting Qualitative Analysis Software</a></li>
											<p>Are you interested in using Qualitative software but don't know how it can help? Are you ready to get started but overwhelmed by all the options to choose from? Are you interested in knowing how the softwares differ?  Learn about the various features of Qualitative software and what factors I consider when helping people select the right software for them. We will discuss: NVivo, MAXQDA, Atlas.ti, QDA Miner, Dedoose, Quirkos, QualCoder, Taguette, Excel/Spreadhseets, and Word.</p>
											<li><a href="https://dataservices.gmu.edu/files/GentleR.pdf">Gentle Introduction to R</a></li>
											<p>Learn what R can do for you and why everybody is talking about it. Get some hands on experience, and tips for increasing your comfort. Intended for those who have little to no programming experience.</p>
                                            <li><a href="http://dataservices.gmu.edu/files/R_with_Dplyr.pdf">Getting Acquainted with R</a></li>
											<p>This workshop is for those familiar with other statistical software to learn the fundamentals of using R with datasets. Topics include: Using R and RStudio, Building blocks of the R language, R syntax, including functions, objects, vectors, and dataframes, Opening and examining datasets, Working with variables and values, and Packages and enhanced user interfaces.
												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED basic statistics knowledge (undergrad-level)
												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED experience working with datasets using other statistical software (e.g., SPSS, Stata, SAS, MatLab, advanced Excel…)
												Familiarity with syntax, code, or other programming is recommended</p>
											<li><a href="http://dataservices.gmu.edu/files/SAS-Studio-Overview.pdf">Introduction to SAS</a></li>
											<p>Learn the interface and basic structure of SAS syntax while inputting and displaying data. No prior experience with SAS or programming is necessary.</p>
											<li><a href="http://dataservices.gmu.edu/files/Surviving-SPSS.pdf">SPSS I</a></li>
											<p>Become familiar with the ins-and-outs of SPSS by exploring a dataset. Review the interface (including the status bar), computing and recoding variables, and simple tables. Discover features and options that are helpful but often overlooked. Intended for people who have never used SPSS before as well as those who have. Participants expected to have basic knowledge of data and datafiles.</p>
											<li><a href="http://dataservices.gmu.edu/files/Surviving-SPSS-COMM.pdf">SPSS II</a></li>
											<p>Learn how to make the output window can help keep your data and results organized. Other topics include: importing text files, creating charts, visual binning, and dealing with dates. Participants are encouraged to take SPSS I first.</p>
											<li><a href="http://dataservices.gmu.edu/files/SPSS-Syntax.pdf">SPSS with Syntax</a></li>
											<p>If you will use SPSS for a thesis or dissertation, it is highly recommend that you be familiar with SPSS Syntax. This workshop will cover the basics of reading and saving syntax. Plus, discover how using Syntax can help you save time, reduce errors, and stay organized. Participants should be familiar with SPSS.</p>
											<li><a href="https://dsc.gmu.edu/files/surviving_stata.pdf">Surviving Stata / Intro to Stata</a></li>
											<p>Learn the ins-and-outs of Stata’s interface, syntax, and help documentation. This workshop will help new users feel comfortable with Stata (using Syntax), give tips and advice to existing users, and give all attendees the tools to find out more.</p>
											<li><a href="https://dataservices.gmu.edu/files/Stata-for-Theses.pdf">Stata for Theses</a></li>
											<p>This workshop gives an overview of advanced and useful features of Stat, including: How to open data files from different sources commands to clean and process data, do file organization and use, user-written functions and ado files, prefix commands (e.g., by and svy)</p>
